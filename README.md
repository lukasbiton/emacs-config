My personal emacs config file, with minimum fiddling required.

Note that vterm needs extra stuff to be downloaded, see https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm for more information.
Note that if Nerd Fonts are not installed, this will install them on your computer.

Note that this config uses eglot and has a set-up for python and clangd. For python, if you use poetry and pyenv to have a locally installed .venv folder, this config finds your LSP directly (tested only with jedi-language-server).
