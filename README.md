My personal emacs config file, with minimum fiddling required.

Note that vterm needs extra stuff to be downloaded, see https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm for more information.
Note that if Nerd Fonts are not installed, this will install them on your computer.
Note that I still haven't figured out how to automatically give my local .venv to eglot and still do it by hand.
